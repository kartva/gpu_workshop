## What's a workshop?

Workshops are our way to introduce folks to the magic of Purdue Hackers! Participants go through a short guided coding session, and then remix and hack their own modifications to make the project their own!

## Overview

[Slides here.](presentation/presentation.pdf) Used notebooks (+ solutions) are in the repo as well. Recording available on request.
